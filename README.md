# The MNIST Implementation Project
Hey there!

This will be a working space to implement various types of neural networks on the MNIST dataset and do it with various tools. I'm a huge believer in learning by doing, and especially by doing so in public :). As such, I'm going to be implementing the following starting from scratch -- well, as long as you count Numpy as scratch -- and then working our way up to food chain and getting to more complicated frameworks like Pytorch.

I'm specifically using this MNIST dataset and building on it because it's a great way to build something to build an understanding of the actual processes under the frameworks (i.e. Pytorch, Tensorflow, etc...) and understand the differences between different kinds of models -- in this project, feedforward neural networks vs convolutional neural networks!

You can read more of my notes on my website [here](https://www.mattkos.com), follow me on twitter/X [here](https://x.com/mattkosze/), and please shoot me a message with any concerns or things I missed.

Enjoy!
