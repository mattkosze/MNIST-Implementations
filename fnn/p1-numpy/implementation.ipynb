I'll briefly go over it, but if you need a better introduction to dense layers I would recommend the book *Neural Networks from Scratch* by Kinsley and Kukieła.\n",

    "# Section 1: The Forward Pass of Dense Layers\n",

    "At the core level, the way a neural network layer works is matrix multiplication. We can work through an example for this. Let's think of this as creating a function where we input a list X, of length 3 with integers, and it outputs a list Y, of length 4 with sum(X) in each entry. You can look at the diagram below for an example:\n",

    "Skip this if you understand matrix multiplication: effectively, what we're doing is just a function that carries out matrix multiplication. Matrix multiplication is done by the element wise multiplication of two matrices of sizes (n x m) and (m x p), respectively. As you can see there, that middle dimension adding up is key, and that's because we're doing row x column. I won't go too into the weeds there, but let's look at a mini-example -- almost recursive if that makes sense :). Let's say we're trying to multiply a matrix X of size (1 x 2) times another matrix Y of size (2 x 2). That can be done because the middle dimension lines up. If matrix X is [a, b] and matrix Y is [[c, d],[e, f]]. That is, where every column of matrix Y represents the weights of one neuron as a column vector. Then, what matrix multiplication is doing is just [(a\\*c + a\\*e), (b\\*d + b\\*f)]. That's it for this recursive example, and I hope that makes sense.\n",

    "\n",
    "I've waited to introduce all the underlying concepts so that we can work through the idea of backpropagation with a complete picture of how a forward pass really works. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the surface level, backpropagation may seem to be the most complex part of our neural network -- but I'll try to do my best to explain it succinctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of backpropagation lies the principle of the chain rule, from calculus. First, let's give an example of how a single neuron sums up its inputs and applies an activation function, from which we can then have an intuition of how the chain rule applies.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the above image, it shows how a neuron would process inputs and apply the ReLU activation function to them. It's pretty simple, and the red numbers are values passed through the system, whereas black numbers are parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we look at it from right to left, we're using the outputs of previous actions to complete the next step. So, what that means here is: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "ReLU(sum(i_{0} \\times w_{0}, i_{1} \\times w_{1}, i_{2} \\times w_{2}, i_{3} \\times w_{3}, bias))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "That is, where $i_{x}$ is the x'th input and $w_{x}$ is the x'th weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, for us to find the derivative of this, we need to apply the chain rule, which states that:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{d}{dx}[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \\times g'(x)\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "We keep applying this chain rule recursively to find the gradients -- which are vectors of partial derivatives with respect to each variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "I won't dive much deeper into partial derivatives, but I would recommend that you pick up a book like Neural Networks from Scratch by Kinsley and Kukieła to learn more about it :). Now, we need to implement the backward pass methods for each component!\n",
